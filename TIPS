Format
--------------------------------------------------.
I have used comment separators to divide the original js file into 5 sections, mainly:
1. Configurations
2. Draw functions (Scene, Hit)
3. Helper functions 
4. Exports


Terminologies
--------------------------------------------------.
* Parent vs source
Parent: what it is pointed by
Source: what it is pointing at
* Objects
A single entity with properties drawn on a scene
* Scene
A scene is like a drawing board 
* Viewport 
Each viewport has a scene 
Each viewport has multiple layers
* Layer
Each layer has a scene


Good Practices
--------------------------------------------------.
1. Save and restore
Remember to save and restore when the draw function involves configuring the context 
eg. fillStyle, lineWidth
This is to prevent style leak 
2. Style (eg. Font, fillStyle, lineWidth) just before stroke() or fill()
This is to prevent style contamination, we dont know when a style will be leaked from other functions 
3. Scene clear() 
* Clear all scenes before invoking all drawing functions (already implemented)
* Before drawing the first object on the layer (usu. at the start of drawSceneObjects function)
eg. If each object of the same type has a separate layer, put at the singular side
If all objects of the same type are in the same layer, put at the plural side
4. Viewport.render()
render() after drawing the last object on the layer (usu. put in the same block as scene clear())
Only needed for drawScene not drawHit
5. Always collect all objects before drawing 
Push the objects into an array then draw it by Invoking drawSceneObjects()
6. When set up a new object (eg. ArrayObject), follow this rules:
* Name the object by appending -Object 
* Configure the key 
* Configure an empty array eg. arrowObjects = [];
* Configure the layer (add it to LAYERS array)
* Set initialiseObject helper
* Set up the draw function (ie. the drawScene and drawHit) (always good to have a drawHit, even if not needed)
* Add Event handlers (mouse move and click)
* Add draw functions to DRAW_ON_START_UP array
* Set up reset array assignment
7. Dont use var to declare, use either let or const
8. Try not to draw on other contexts in a draw function
since it is hard to have control over other context in the event handler
9. To Stringify a value, use this:
"" + 



Tips
--------------------------------------------------.
* When push back to SOURCE ACADEMY 
Just undo comments tagged with ‘Enable in production’
* Code that have issues are tagged with ‘TO-DO:’
* Debugging (it is better to debug using a cloned version of the object since console only shows the final state)
Eg. console.log(“object: ”, { …object });



Others
--------------------------------------------------.
* FunctionObjects
Have these properties (in the program context) (sent form the interpreter)
*Normal functions, library functions:
Node, environment, originalNode, functionName, fun
*Primitive:
hasVarArgs, toString
